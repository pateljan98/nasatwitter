## The Project

For the project, we will use Python code in order to access the Twitter and Instagram API's to collect the data that we need. We will be looking at the NASA pages and figure out which posts are more popular amongst people by looking at what receives the most likes, comments, and retweets.

In addition, we will use the Natural Language Toolkit to help us analyze the data that is collected. An analysis will be made at the end in order to see what content was and wasn't popular along with potential reasons why that was the case.
